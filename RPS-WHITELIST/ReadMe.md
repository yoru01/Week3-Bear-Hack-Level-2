# MY BEAR CHALLENGE LEVEL 2 SUBMISSION
This is a whitelisitng selection script, that two player Alice and Bob have to participate in to get a whitelist spot which their reward is a a certain amount of my non network token (TK).

The selection process involves the participants to play a game of rock paper scissors whereby the winner gets the whitelist spot and the tokens. 

I reckon that all the objectives of the challenge have been met
